<h2>All About Matthew Swan</h2>
<p>My name is Matthew Swan and I am 13 years old. I am a student at Great Walstead School where I am at present studying for common entrance. My favourite subjects at school are science, maths, history and ICT. After school I attend an electronics club, an ICT club and a Scout group. In electronics we are learning about the components that make up a circuit board and are undertaking various projects. At home I live with my Mum, Dad and sister Charlotte. My Dad works for a Chicago based software company where he does Cloud computing and my Mum is a nursery teacher. I spend a lot of my spare time programming or learning more about programming, I also enjoy gaming. Some of my favourite games are Minecraft and the <a href="https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/">Kerbel space programme</a>. On a Saturday I attend Gielgud Academy where I study drama and singing. I recently auditioned for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in the West End and this was an amazing experience as I got down to the last five. Last month I got a Merit in my Grade 2 singing exam and I am now practising for Grade 3.</p>

<h2>Codecademy</h2>
<p>Before I started using <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> I didn't know that their were different languages for writing code. I have found it one of the most useful resources to learning how to code as it teaches you in a simple and clear way. </p>
<h3>Javascript</h3>
<p>This was the first language that I learnt to use and the first big project that I did with it on Codecademy was to use my knowledge of Javascript to make a game called 'Fizz Buzz'. I’ve also completed Javascipt modules on <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Kahn Academy</a>.</p>
<h3>HTML</h3>
<p>This is the second language that I studied on Codecademy and is now my second most commonly used programming language. I have used HTML to write this website and three others.</p>
<h3>Ruby</h3>
<h3>Python</h3>
<h3>PHP </h3>
<h2>Books/Magazines</h2>
<h3>'Code' by Charles Petzold</h3>
<p>I am reading this book at the moment and I am finding it very interesting to see how many different types of code there are. This book teaches you everything from Morse code, Braille, through to Binary. Reading this book has taught me a lot about different electrical circuits and about lots of logic gates. Before I read '<a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/code/">Code</a>' I never knew about Xor or Coincidence Gates, I feel that knowing about these will be helpful to me as a Xor Gate would be required to build a machine that could add and subtract. I have learned how all digital circuits can be made from Nand gates, up to the most sophisticated CPUs.</p>

<h3>The Magpi</h3>
<p>This is a magazine for Raspberry Pi users. I have used <a href="http://www.themagpi.com/">The Magpi</a> to get ideas for projects that I could do. One of the projects that I have undertaken from these magazines is the Bat and Ball game.</p>
